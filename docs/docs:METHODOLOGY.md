\f0\fs24 \cf0 # Data Methodology & Transparency\
\
**Last Updated**: November 7, 2025\
\
## Our Commitment\
\
CanadaScanada is built on **verifiable, sourced, transparent data**. This document explains how we collect, verify, and present information.\
\
---\
\
## Data Sources\
\
### Priority Events (60 Curated)\
**Selection Criteria**:\
- Significant policy impact\
- Rights implications\
- Financial consequences >$1M\
- Precedent-setting decisions\
- Public interest relevance\
\
**Sources**:\
1. **Primary**: Government documents, legislation, Hansard transcripts\
2. **Secondary**: QCJO-designated news outlets (CBC, Globe and Mail, etc.)\
3. **Tertiary**: Independent verified journalism (The Tyee, Canadaland)\
\
**Not Accepted**:\
- Social media posts without verification\
- Anonymous blogs\
- Unverified claims\
\
### Appendix Dataset (431 Decisions)\
**Source**: Community-contributed dataset by Bailrs (2019-2023)\
\
**Verification Process**:\
1. Each decision includes news source URL\
2. URLs validated as active and accessible\
3. Decisions matched to ministries via public records\
4. Dates cross-referenced where available\
\
**Limitations**:\
- Some source URLs may become inactive over time\
- Exact dates not available for all decisions (approximations noted)\
\
### Media Organizations (30 Profiles)\
**Data Sources**:\
- **QCJO Status**: Canada Revenue Agency official QCJO list\
- **CRTC Licensing**: CRTC public database\
- **Ownership**: Corporate registry filings, SEC filings (US companies), shareholder reports\
- **Political Endorsements**: Editorial board statements, archived articles\
\
**Update Frequency**: Quarterly review of ownership changes\
\
---\
\
## Analysis Framework\
\
### Rights Impact Assessment\
**Method**:\
- Identify which Charter sections affected (if any)\
- Document government's stated justification\
- Note any court challenges or legal opinions\
- Assess scope (individual, group, systemic)\
\
**Not Legal Advice**: Our analysis is educational, not legal counsel.\
\
### Theoretical Frameworks\
**Scholars Applied**:\
- **Michel Foucault**: Governmentality, disciplinary power, biopolitics\
- **Marshall McLuhan**: Medium/message analysis, media effects\
- **Hannah Arendt**: Totalitarian markers, public/private erosion, political violence\
- **Umberto Eco**: Ur-Fascism checklist (14 points)\
\
**Application Method**:\
1. Read original scholar texts\
2. Identify relevant concepts for event\
3. Apply concept with specific evidence\
4. Cite scholar's work\
\
**Not Claiming Events ARE X**: We analyze *patterns* using these frameworks, not making definitive claims about totalitarianism, fascism, etc.\
\
### Connection Types\
Events linked by:\
- **Sequential**: Same policy area, chronological order\
- **Financial**: Shared budget/funding source\
- **Actor**: Same political figure involved\
- **Thematic**: Similar pattern or approach\
- **Causal**: One event directly caused another (with evidence)\
\
---\
\
## Verification Standards\
\
### URL Validation\
- All sources must be accessible via working URL\
- URLs archived via Wayback Machine where possible\
- If URL breaks, we note "Link inactive as of [date]" and provide alternative source\
\
### Date Accuracy\
- **Priority Events**: Exact dates verified via news reports or official records\
- **Appendix Events**: Best-effort dating; marked as "Approximate: [timeframe]" if exact date unavailable\
\
### Financial Figures\
- All dollar amounts sourced from:\
  - Government budgets\
  - Financial reports\
  - Independent fiscal analysis\
- Amounts noted as "Estimated" if not officially confirmed\
\
### Quote Attribution\
- All quotes include:\
  - Speaker name\
  - Date\
  - Source URL\
  - Full context (not cherry-picked)\
\
---\
\
## Editorial Process\
\
### What We Do\
\uc0\u9989  **Curate**: Select events of public interest significance  \
\uc0\u9989  **Verify**: Confirm sources are credible and accessible  \
\uc0\u9989  **Contextualize**: Provide background and connections  \
\uc0\u9989  **Analyze**: Apply theoretical frameworks to identify patterns  \
\uc0\u9989  **Cite**: Link every claim to source  \
\
### What We DON'T Do\
\uc0\u10060  **Editorialize**: Present opinion as fact  \
\uc0\u10060  **Cherry-pick**: Hide contradictory evidence  \
\uc0\u10060  **Fabricate**: Make unsourced claims  \
\uc0\u10060  **Exaggerate**: Use inflammatory language  \
\
### Corrections Policy\
When errors are identified:\
1. User submits correction via form (with supporting source)\
2. We review within 7 days\
3. If valid, we update event and add "Corrected [date]" note\
4. If disputed, we add "Multiple perspectives exist" note with both sources\
\

\
## Limitations & Biases\
\
### Acknowledged Limitations\
- **English-language bias**: Most sources are English (working on French content)\
- **News media dependence**: Rely on journalism quality of sources\
- **Recency bias**: More detail on recent events than older ones\
- **Alberta focus**: MVP concentrated on Alberta; other provinces underrepresented\
\
### Our Perspective\
**Canadian Civic Values**:\
- Support for Charter rights\
- Transparency in government\
- Independent journalism\
- Evidence-based policy\
\
**We Believe**:\
- Democracy requires informed citizens\
- Media ownership affects content\
- Rights protections matter\
- Pattern recognition is valid analysis\
\
**We Are Not**:\
- Partisan (no party affiliation)\
- Funded by political groups\
- Advocating specific policy positions (beyond transparency)\
\

\
## Data Governance\
